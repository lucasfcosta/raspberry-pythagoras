			"Did you know I can convert units like kilograms, inches, kms/h, cms, grams, degrees fahrenheit and so on?",
			"Hey guys, this is not a tip, It's just me bragging about how smart I am.",
			"Time for a tip!\nYou can use different measure units on your operations and tell the result's desired unit.\nJust like: \"5cm + 0.2m in inch\"",
			"New tip!\nYou can represent matrices like: [1, 1, 1; 2, 2, 2]. The \";\" character separates the lines.",
			"Killer tip!\nYou can also operate using matrices, like: \"[1,2; 2,3] * [4,5; 6,7]\"",
