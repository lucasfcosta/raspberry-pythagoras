A Twitter bot that answers math questions.


## Installing

*To run raspberry-pythagoras you don't need a Raspberry Pi.*
Currently I'm running mine on a Raspberry Pi B 2, but it's not needed at all.

1. Clone this repository
2. [Register a new Twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/) to get your API Keys
3. Fill the api.json file with your Twitter API keys
4. Open your terminal and install dependencies for this project using the command `npm install`
5. Run the main script with `node app.js`

You are now running your own version of raspberry-pythagoras!

*Important:* I also recommend that you change the screen name you are using to filter incoming tweets, currently it's set up to my default [@raspythagoras](https://twitter.com/raspythagoras) username.
